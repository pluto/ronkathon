# Modes of Operation

Block ciphers can only do fixed length encryption of bits in a well-defined Block. Modes of operation allows to extend cipher's encryption/decryption algorithms to allow arbitrary length data.

Some operations require *Initialisation vector* (IV) that must not repeat for subsequent encryption operations, and must be random for some operations. IV is used so that different ciphertext is generated for same plaintext even for a single key. We demonstrate this in our [tests](./cbc.rs).

Appropriate padding has to be performed for some modes, as block ciphers only work of fixed size blocks. Since, most of the ciphers are used with [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code) that provides integrity guarantees and prevent Chosen-Ciphertext attacks on the protocol, so, [any](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/62379/choice-of-padding-scheme-to-prevent-cbc-padding-oracle-attacks) padding scheme works, most common is PKCS#7 or even null byte padding. Note that, without use of MACs, almost all block ciphers with padding are susceptible to [Padding Oracle Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) and should be handled with utmost care.

Let's go into detail about Block cipher's [mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation):

## ECB: Electronic codebook
- deterministic, so not CPA-secure.
- can be parallelised easily.
## CBC: cipher block chaining
- IV chosen uniformly and $c_{0}=IV$, then $c_{i}=F_{k}(c_{i-1} \oplus m_{i})$
- sequential in nature, although decryption can be parallelised as inputs to block cipher's encryption is just the ciphertext
- chained CBC, where ciphertext is chained for subsequent encryptions.
  - But it's not CPA secure, as attacker can distinguish between PRF and uniform random function by choosing appropriate text in second encryption.
## OFB: output feedback
- IV is chosen uniformly and $y_{0}:=IV$, then $y_{i}=F_{k}(y_{i-1})$ and $c_{i}=y_{i} \oplus m_{i}$.
- this allows $F_{k}$ to not be invertible, and can be simply a PRF.
- Due to this, OFB can be used to encrypt plaintext of arbitrary lengths and not have to be multiple of block length.
- pseudorandom stream can be preprocessed and then encryption can be really fast.
- it's stateful variant can be used to instantiate stream cipher's synchronised mode of operation and is secure.
## CTR: counter mode
- can be viewed as unsynchronised stream cipher mode, where $y_{i}=F_{k}(\langle IV \parallel i\rangle)$ for binary string $i = 1,2,\dots,$ and $c_{i}=y_{i}\oplus m_{i}$.
- this again allows $F_{k}$ to not be invertible and can be instantiated with a Pseudorandom function.
- can be fully parallelised.

## GCM: Galois/Counter Mode

GCM is a block cipher mode of operation that provides both confidentiality and authentication.
To provide confidentiality, it uses Counter(CTR) mode for encryption and decryption.
To provide authentication, it uses a universal hash function, GHASH.
Authentication is provided not only for confidential data but also other associated data.

In this section, we will give an informal overview of GCM mode for 128-bit block cipher.
*To see the formal definition of the operations of GCM, I recommend reading the original paper. [The Galois/Counter Mode of Operation (GCM)](https://csrc.nist.rip/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/gcm/gcm-revised-spec.pdf)*

The two operations of GCM are authenticated encryption and authenticated decryption.

Here is a figure that gives a complete overview of the authenticated encryption in GCM. 

In the figure, we have taken
- the size of plaintext is `3 * 128-bit = 384 bits or 48 bytes`, 
- Additionally Authenticated Data(AAD) is of `2 * 128-bit = 248 bits or 32 bytes`.

![GCM](./figure_full_gcm.svg)
*Note: The yellow diamonds represent functions/algorithms, the small rectangle with a blue outline represents 128-bit blocks.*
Also,
- *Enc(K)*: The encryption operation of the cipher used, for example AES, under the key K.
- *incr*: The increment function, which treats the rightmost 32-bit of the block as an unsigned integer and increments it by 1.

If you look at the figure carefully, you will notice that the GCM mode is composed of two main parts:
- Encryption: This part is the same as the CTR mode of operation, with minor changes to the counter block.
- Authentication: In this part, we generate an authentication tag for the ciphertext and some additional data, which we refer to as Additionally Authenticated Data(AAD).

The counter block is the same as in CTR mode. In general, it can be thought of as a 96-bit nonce value followed by a 32-bit counter value.

The tag is generated by XOR of:
1. Hash of ciphertext and AAD, using GHASH algorithm
2. Encryption of Counter block 0.

### GHASH

The GHASH algorithm can be viewed as a series of `ADD and MULTIPLY` in $GF(2^{128})$. Mathematically put the basic operation of GHASH is,

$$
X_{i} =
\begin{cases}
0  & \quad i = 0 \\
( X_{i-1} \oplus B_{i} ) * H & \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$B_{i}$ represents blocks of AAD followed by blocks of ciphertext followed by a special length block.
The length block consists of 64-bit lengths(in bits) of AAD and ciphertext.
$H$ called the hash key, is the encryption of 128-bit of zeros using the chosen cipher and key.

The interesting thing to note here is that the multiplication($*$) and addition($\oplus$) are operations of the Galois(finite) field of order $2^{128}$. 
A brief summary of finite field arithmetic,
- The elements of the field are represented as polynomials. Each bit of the 128-bit block represents coefficients of a polynomial of degree strictly less than 128.
- Addition in a finite field is equivalent to bitwise XOR.
- Multiplication in a finite field is the multiplication of corresponding polynomials modulo an irreducible reducing polynomial.

In GCM the reducing polynomial is $f = 1 + x + x^2 + x^7 + x^{128}$

If you want to read about Finite Field, the Wikipedia article on [Finite Field Arithemtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) is pretty good!

The authenticated decryption operation is identical to authenticated encryption, except the tag is generated before the decryption.
