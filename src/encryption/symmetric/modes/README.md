# Modes of Operation

Block ciphers can only do fixed length encryption of bits in a well-defined Block. Modes of operation allows to extend cipher's encryption/decryption algorithms to allow arbitrary length data.

Some operations require *Initialisation vector* (IV) that must not repeat for subsequent encryption operations, and must be random for some operations. IV is used so that different ciphertext is generated for same plaintext even for a single key. We demonstrate this in our [tests](./cbc.rs).

Appropriate padding has to be performed for some modes, as block ciphers only work of fixed size blocks. Since, most of the ciphers are used with [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code) that provides integrity guarantees and prevent Chosen-Ciphertext attacks on the protocol, so, [any](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/62379/choice-of-padding-scheme-to-prevent-cbc-padding-oracle-attacks) padding scheme works, most common is PKCS#7 or even null byte padding. Note that, without use of MACs, almost all block ciphers with padding are susceptible to [Padding Oracle Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) and should be handled with utmost care.

Let's go into detail about Block cipher's [mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation):

## ECB: Electronic codebook
- deterministic, so not CPA-secure.
- can be parallelised easily.
## CBC: cipher block chaining
- IV chosen uniformly and $c_{0}=IV$, then $c_{i}=F_{k}(c_{i-1} \oplus m_{i})$
- sequential in nature, although decryption can be parallelised as inputs to block cipher's encryption is just the ciphertext
- chained CBC, where ciphertext is chained for subsequent encryptions.
  - But it's not CPA secure, as attacker can distinguish between PRF and uniform random function by choosing appropriate text in second encryption.
## OFB: output feedback
- IV is chosen uniformly and $y_{0}:=IV$, then $y_{i}=F_{k}(y_{i-1})$ and $c_{i}=y_{i} \oplus m_{i}$.
- this allows $F_{k}$ to not be invertible, and can be simply a PRF.
- Due to this, OFB can be used to encrypt plaintext of arbitrary lengths and not have to be multiple of block length.
- pseudorandom stream can be preprocessed and then encryption can be really fast.
- it's stateful variant can be used to instantiate stream cipher's synchronised mode of operation and is secure.
## CTR: counter mode
- can be viewed as unsynchronised stream cipher mode, where $y_{i}=F_{k}(\langle IV \parallel i\rangle)$ for binary string $i = 1,2,\dots,$ and $c_{i}=y_{i}\oplus m_{i}$.
- this again allows $F_{k}$ to not be invertible and can be instantiated with a Pseudorandom function.
- can be fully parallelised.

## GCM: Galois/Counter Mode

Here is a figure that gives a complete overview of the GCM mode of operation. In the figure, the size of plaintext is 3 * 128-bit = 384 bits or 48 bytes, Additionally Authenticated Data
(AAD) is of 2 * 128-bit = 248 bits or 32 bytes.

If you look at the figure carefully, you will notice that the GCM mode is composed of two main parts:
- Encryption: In this part, we encrypt the plaintext and generate the ciphertext. This part is the same as the CTR mode of operation, with minor changes to the counter block.
- Authentication: In this part, we generate an authentication tag based on Galois Field multiplication.

## Next Steps
Implement more modes, and subsequent attacks/vulnerabilities:
- [ ] CFB
- [ ] OFB
