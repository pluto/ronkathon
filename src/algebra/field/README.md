# Field

## Traits

- `FiniteField`: a field $(\mathbb{F}_p, +,\cdot)$ where $p$ is a prime number.
- `ExtensionField`: an extension of a field $(\mathbb{F}_{p^k}, +,\cdot)$ where $p$ is a prime number and $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ is an extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$.


The two traits used in this module are `FiniteField` and `ExtensionField` which are located in the `field` and `field::extension` modules respectively.
These traits are interfacial components that provide the necessary functionality for field-like objects to adhere to to be used in cryptographic systems.


### `FiniteField`
The `FiniteField` trait is used to define a finite field in general.
The trait itself mostly requires functionality from traits in the Rust [`core::ops`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/) module such as `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, and `Div` (and their corresponding assignment, iterator, and related operations).
In effect, these constraints provide us the algebraic structure of a field.

A bit more specifically, the `FiniteField` trait requires the following associated constants and (const) methods:
- `const ORDER: Self` - The order of the field.
- `const ZERO: Self` - The additive identity.
- `const ONE: Self` - The multiplicative identity.
- `const PRIMITIVE_ELEMENT: Self` - A [primitive element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_element_(finite_field)) of the field, that is, a generator of the multiplicative subgroup of the field.
- `inverse(&self) -> Option<Self>` - The multiplicative inverse of a nonzero field element.
Returns `None` if the element is zero.
- `pow(&self, power: usize) -> Self` - Multiply a field element by itself `power` times.
- `primitive_root_of_unity(n: usize) -> Self` - The primitive $n$th root of unity of the field.

### `ExtensionField`
The `ExtensionField` trait is used to define an extension field of a finite field.
It inherits from the `FiniteField` trait and enforces that algebraic operations from the base field are implemented.
It is generic over the prime `P` of the underlying base field as well as the degree `N` of the extension intended.
The only additional constraint aside from the `FiniteField` trait and adherance to algebraic operations on the base field is:
- `const IRREDUCIBLE_POLYNOMIAL_COEFFICIENTS: [PrimeField<P>; N + 1]` - The coefficients of the irreducible polynomial that defines the extension field.

We will discuss `PrimeField<P>` momentarily.


## Structs
The structs that implement these traits are
- `PrimeField`
- `GaloisField`

> [!NOTE]
> In principal, `PrimeField` and `GaloisField` could be combined into just `GaloisField` but are separated for clarity at the moment.
> These structs are both generic over the prime `P` of the field, but `GaloisField` is also generic over the degree `N` of the extension field.

### `PrimeField`
The `PrimeField` struct is a wrapper around a `usize` by:
```rust
pub struct PrimeField<const P: usize> {
    value: usize,
}
```
that implements the `FiniteField` trait and has some compile-time constructions.
For example, upon creation of an element of `PrimeField<P>` we utilize the `const fn is_prime<const P: usize>()` function which will `panic!` if `P` is not prime.
**Hence, it is impossible to compile a program for which you construct `PrimeField<P>` where `P` is not prime.**

Furthermore, it is possible to determine the `PRIMITIVE_ELEMENT` of the field at compile time so that we may implement `FiniteField` for any prime `P` without any runtime overhead.
The means to do so is done in the `field::prime::find_primitive_element` function which is a brute force search for a primitive element of the field that occurs as Rust compiles `ronkathon`.

All of the relevant arithmetic operations for `PrimeField<P>` are implemented in `field::prime::arithmetic`.

### `GaloisField`
The `GaloisField` struct is a wrapper around a `PrimeField<P>` by:
```rust
use ronkathon::algebra::field::prime::PrimeField;
pub struct GaloisField<const N: usize, const P: usize> {
    value: [PrimeField<P>; N],
}
```
where the `[PrimeField<P>; N]` is the representation of the field element as coefficients to a polynomial in the base field modulo the irreducible polynomial of the extension field (recall the `ExtensionField` trait above specifies the need for an irreducible polynomial).

We implement `ExtensionField` for specific instances of `GaloisField<N, P>` as, at the moment, we do not have a general compile-time-based implementation of extension fields as we do with `PrimeField<P>`, though it is possible to do so.
Instead, we have implemented much of the arithmetic operations for `GaloisField<N, P>` in `field::extension::arithmetic`, but left some that needs to be computed by hand for the user to implement (for now).
See, for instance, `field::extension::gf_101_2` implements the `IRREDUCIBLE_POLYNOMIAL_COEFFICIENTS` for `GaloisField<2, 101>` as well as the remaining arithmetic operations.
There is a method to compute both the `IRREDUCIBLE_POLYNOMIAL_COEFFICIENTS` at compile time as well as the `PRIMITIVE_ELEMENT` of the field, but it is not implemented at the moment.
