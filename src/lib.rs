//! # ronkathon
//! This crate is a library intended for educational purposes. It provides implementations of
//! various cryptographic primitives and protocols, such as polynomial commitments, zero-knowledge
//! proofs, and elliptic curve operations. The library is designed to be simple and easy to
//! understand, with a focus on clarity and correctness rather than performance.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Finite fields: Implementations of finite fields and extension fields, including arithmetic
//!   operations and field elements.
//! - Polynomials: Implementations of polynomials in various bases, with support for arithmetic
//!   operations such as addition, multiplication, and division.
//! - Elliptic curves: Implementations of elliptic curves over finite fields, with support for
//!   operations such as point addition, scalar multiplication, and pairing operations.
//! - Compiler: Simple DSL to write circuits which can be compiled to polynomials used in PLONK.
