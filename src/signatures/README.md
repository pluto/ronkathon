# Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are cryptographic primitives that provide three essential security properties:

1. **Authentication** - Verifies the identity of the signer
2. **Non-repudiation** - The signer cannot deny having signed the message
3. **Integrity** - The message has not been altered since signing

## How Digital Signatures Work

Digital signatures typically involve two main operations:

1. **Signing**: Using a private key to generate a signature for a message
   - Input: Message + Private Key
   - Output: Signature

2. **Verification**: Using a public key to verify the signature matches the message
   - Input: Message + Signature + Public Key 
   - Output: True/False (valid/invalid)

## Types of Digital Signatures

### Traditional Signatures (e.g. ECDSA)
- Based on elliptic curve cryptography
- Widely used in Bitcoin and other blockchains
- Each signature is independent
- Size grows linearly with number of signers

### BLS Signatures
- Based on bilinear pairings on elliptic curves
- Allows signature aggregation
- Multiple signatures can be combined into one
- Constant size regardless of number of signers
- More computationally intensive than ECDSA

## Use Cases

- Document signing
- Software authentication
- Blockchain transactions
- Secure messaging
- Identity verification

## Security Considerations

- Private keys must be kept secure
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Implement proper key management
- Be aware of potential attacks (e.g. replay attacks)
- Use standardized implementations when possible
