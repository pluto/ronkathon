# BLS Signatures Module

## Overview

The BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signatures module provides an implementation of the BLS digital signature scheme, which is based on pairing-based cryptography. BLS signatures are known for their short signature lengths and the ability to aggregate multiple signatures into a single compact signature, making them particularly useful in blockchain and distributed systems.

## Key Features

- **Short Signatures**: BLS signatures are significantly shorter than traditional signatures, which reduces storage and transmission costs.
- **Signature Aggregation**: Multiple signatures can be combined into a single signature, allowing for efficient verification and reduced on-chain data.
- **Security**: BLS signatures provide strong security guarantees based on the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in pairing-friendly groups.

## How BLS Signatures Work

### Key Generation

1. **Private Key**: A random value is selected as the private key.
2. **Public Key**: The public key is derived from the private key using a generator point in the elliptic curve.

### Signing

To sign a message, the following steps are performed:

1. **Hashing**: The message is hashed to produce a fixed-size output.
2. **Signature Generation**: The signature is generated by multiplying the hashed message with the private key.

### Verification

To verify a signature, the following steps are performed:

1. **Hashing**: The original message is hashed to produce a fixed-size output.
2. **Signature Verification**: The signature is verified by checking the pairing of the public key, the hashed message, and the signature.

## Signature Aggregation

Multiple signatures can be aggregated into a single signature, which can then be verified against the combined public keys. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple parties sign the same message.

### Basic Principle
Given multiple (message, signature) pairs from different signers:
- (m₁, σ₁) from signer 1
- (m₂, σ₂) from signer 2
- ...
- (mₙ, σₙ) from signer n

We can combine them into a single aggregate signature: $σ\_agg = σ_1 + σ_2 + ... + σ_n$

### Properties
1. **Size Efficiency**: The aggregate signature has the same size as a single signature
2. **Verification Efficiency**: Verifying the aggregate signature is faster than verifying n signatures individually
3. **Non-interactivity**: Signers don't need to coordinate or communicate
4. **Public Key Aggregation**: Public keys can also be aggregated

### Mathematical Background

BLS signatures work on special elliptic curves with bilinear pairings. The key components are:

1. **Groups**: Uses two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ with a bilinear mapping $e: G_1 \times G_2 \to G_t$
2. **Hash-to-Curve**: Messages are mapped to curve points using a special hash function
3. **Pairing Check**: Verification uses the bilinear pairing property: $e(g,h)^{ab} = e(g^a,h) = e(g,h^b)$
